# Developer Portfolio Website

## Description

This project is a personal developer portfolio website designed to showcase projects, articles, and skills in a unique and engaging way.

This allows users to navigate the portfolio much like they would navigate a code editor, providing a familiar and intuitive experience.

    *   **Contact:** Ways to get in touch with the developer.
*   **Theme Switcher:** Allows users to change the visual theme of the portfolio (e.g., Dracula, Nord, Ayu, GitHub Dark, Night Owl).
